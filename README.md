This is my personal repository of finished projects from the <b>Data Scientist in Python Learning Path</b> offered by [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/) as part of the Data Science for Social Good Scholarship recipients. 

My goal is to be industry-ready in making end-to-end projects using Python especially for data analytics and statistics.
