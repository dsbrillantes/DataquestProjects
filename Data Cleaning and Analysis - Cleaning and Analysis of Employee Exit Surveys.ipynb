    "## Cleaning and Analysis of Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be performing data cleaning using some of the tools below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vectorized string methods to clean string columns\n",
    "- The `apply()`, `map()`, and `applymap()` methods to transform data\n",
    "- The `fillna()`, `dropna()`, and `drop()` methods to drop missing or unnecessary  values\n",
    "- The `melt()` function to reshape data\n",
    "- The `concat()` and `merge()` functions to combine data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "As we clean and analyze the data, we will try to answer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using both surveys to answer the above questions. However, as we've seen above, while the template used between the two is the same, one of them customized some of the answers."

    "1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "    __A__: If we consider those classified as 'New' as those who've only worked for a short period of time, then dissatisfaction does not seem to be the main driver of resignations. The opposite is true, however, when we look at those who have worked for longer, where there is a direct relationship indicating that dissatisfaction was very much present on those who resigned.\n",

    "2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
